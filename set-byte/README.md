This is a simple script for hex editing files. <BR>
<BR>
set-byte.py is a utility file that takes three parameters: the file, the offset, and the hex value. <BR>
It will change the hexadecimal value at the offset with the one that is passed in. Note, this is an update and NOT an insert.<BR>
It might be a good idea to back up your original files just incase. In fact, I should backup the original file in the python code.<BR>
<BR>
cheat.sh and cheat-simple.sh contain sample set-byte.py calls. <BR>
