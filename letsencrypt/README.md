I've created an "automated" process to upload new letsencrypt certs on my three main raspberry pi servers.<BR>

These will be generated by the pi's hosting the server (wordpress and nextcloud) and uploaded to the "traffic" server. <BR>

nextcloud and wordpress, add in crontab for root:<BR>
0 6 * * * /root/bin/cert.sh<BR>

cert.sh assumes the new cert files have been generated and are in place. The MD5 hash of the file is what determines if it has changed.<BR>
If the file has been changed, its uploaded to the appropriate server.<BR>
If the file has not changed, it will check to see if the file exists on the appropriate server. If it doesnt exist, it uploads it again.<BR>
