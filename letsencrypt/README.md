I've created an "automated" process to generate letsencrypt certs on my three main raspberry pi servers. 

These will be generated by the pi's hosting the server (wordpress and nextcloud) and uploaded to the "traffic" server. 

Add to root cron on wordpress and nextcloud servers:
0 6 * * * /root/bin/cert.sh

Documentation: TODO
