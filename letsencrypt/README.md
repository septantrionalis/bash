I've created an "automated" process to upload new letsencrypt certs on my three main raspberry pi servers. 

These will be generated by the pi's hosting the server (wordpress and nextcloud) and uploaded to the "traffic" server. 

nextcloud and wordpress, add in crontab for root:
0 6 * * * /root/bin/cert.sh

cert.sh assumes the new cert files have been generated and are in place. The MD5 hash of the file is what determines if it has changed.
If the file has been changed, its uploaded to the appropriate server.<BR>
If the file has not changed, it will check to see if the file exists on the appropriate server. If it doesnt exist, it uploads it again.
